Another playtest on the road to our next stable release is ready!

Being in a feature freeze, we focused on fixing bugs and inconsistencies reported by community members to ensure the release is as bug-free as possible.

More notable things that got fixed include:

* An exploit where spies in RA could infiltrate team mate's structures.
* Issues with crushing infantry and walls.
* Issues with units entering transports.
* Visual errors connected to shroud and fog of war.

For details check out the [full changelog](http://changelog.openra.net).

Grab the installer for this playtest [from our download page](/download/) and give it a try!
