<h3>What is OpenRA?</h3>
<p>
  OpenRA is a project that <span class="about-highlight">recreates and modernizes</span> the classic
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer">Command &amp; Conquer</a> real time strategy games.
  We have developed a flexible <span class="about-highlight">open source</span> game engine (the <em>OpenRA engine</em>)
  that provides a common platform for rebuilding and reimagining classic 2D and 2.5D RTS games (the <em>OpenRA mods</em>).
<p>
<p>
  This means that OpenRA is not restricted by the technical limitations of the original closed-source games: it
  includes <span class="about-highlight">native support for modern operating systems and screen resolutions</span>
  (including Windows 10, Mac OS X, and most Linux distros) without relying on emulation or binary hacks, and features
  <span class="about-highlight">integrated online multiplayer</span>.
</p>
<p>
  While we love the classic RTS gameplay, multiplayer game design has evolved significantly since the early 1990's.
  The OpenRA mods include <span class="about-highlight">new features and gameplay improvements</span> that bring them
  into the modern era:
  <ul>
    <li>A choice between &ldquo;right click&rdquo; and classic &ldquo;left click&rdquo; control schemes</li>
	<li>Overhauled sidebar interfaces for managing production</li>
	<li>Support for game replays and an observer interface <span class="about-highlight">designed for streaming</span> games online</li>
	<li>The &ldquo;fog of war&rdquo; that obscures the battlefield outside your units' line of sight</li>
	<li>Civilian structures that can be captured for strategic advantage</li>
	<li>Units gain experience as they fight and improve when they earn new ranks</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  OpenRA is <span class="about-highlight">100% free</span>, and comes bundled with three distinct mods.
  When you run a mod for the first time the game can <span class="about-highlight">automatically
  download</span> the original game assets, or you can use the original game disks.

      The Tiberian Dawn mod focuses on <span class="about-highlight">fast and fluid</span> play, taking

      In a world where Hitler was assassinated and the Third Reich never existed,

      The Red Alert mod focuses on <span class="about-highlight">strategy</span>, providing a range of

      The next major goal for OpenRA is to add support for the second generation of
      Command &amp; Conquer games, starting with Tiberian Sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game engine features to support Tiberian Sun are still <span class="about-highlight">in development</span>.
      The mod is not included with the OpenRA installer, but the source code is available in
      <a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA">our GitHub repository</a>.  Please note that we do not provide support
      for incomplete development builds.

    <p>
      We are working to cleanly separate the OpenRA engine code from our C&amp;C-specific mod details, so that it
      can be used as a <span class="about-highlight">general purpose RTS game engine</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A number of custom mods <a href="http://www.moddb.com/games/openra/mods">already exist</a>, and we provide tools
      such as an ingame map editor and Lua scripting to make OpenRA even more powerful and easy to create and run
      community-created games.
