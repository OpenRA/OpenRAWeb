Welcome to the new OpenRA website. It looks much like the old one but you might notice a few changes, the most noticeable being the news list. We're using an Open-Source Content Management System called SilverStripe which allows us to easily keep you up to date with news and extend the site with new interactive content.

In the coming weeks, we will be implementing a map repository, allowing map makers to upload their maps for easy distribution. A mod repository for doing much the same with mods and finally a master server browser allowing you to see who's playing without having to launch the game.
