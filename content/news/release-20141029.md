Our Halloween 2014 release is now available, and is overflowing with both tricks and treats!<br />
This release includes over 760 commits by 41 contributors since our [July release](/news/release-20140722/).

The most visible change in this release is the redesigned in-game UI:

- The RA mod has received a brand new sidebar.
- Improved [keyboard shortcut](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Hotkeys) configuration, with new defaults based on Tiberium Wars and Red Alert 3.
- The in-game menu has been completely overhauled, and now includes information on mission objectives.
- A new end-game score screen appears once a game is complete.

The other big focus of this release was a complete overhaul of our [map scripting](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Map-scripting) support for creating single-player missions and multi-player minigames.  Our [new Lua API](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Lua-API) is faster, more robust, and provides many new features that were not available in the older API (which has now been removed).

A large number of smaller features have also been included.  A small selection from our [full changelog](http://wiki.openra.net/Changelog) includes:

- The lobby now prevents players from choosing "cheating" colors that are too similar to the terrain.
- Veteran units gain improved reload time and accuracy, and elite units will now heal over time.
- Planes will maintain their distance from each other in a similar fashion to helicopters.
- Servers will now drop players with unresponsive connections to unfreeze stalled games.
- Units will now properly move inside transports, instead of teleporting.
- Tank turrets will now turn to face forward after the unit has finished attacking.
- A number of small balance changes to the Red Alert and Tiberian Dawn mods.
- Many more small bug-fixes and behaviour improvements.

The Red Alert sidebar interface has been given a much-needed facelift and a more compact design.

![Improved single-player missions](/images/news/20141029-missions.png)

Our single-player mission support has improved dramatically with this release.  The bulk of this work is now complete, and so future releases will be able to add more campaign missions.

![Connection notification](/images/news/20141012-connection.png)

Game servers will detect when a player causes extended periods of lag, and disconnect them from the game.  This should resolve the situations where a multiplayer game would freeze after a player drops.

![Tiberian Sun progress](/images/news/20141012-tibsun.png)

Work is slowly progressing on our Tiberian Sun mod.  The features that we have been developing for TS<br />(such as EMP weapons and stealth generators) are available for use in mods and custom maps.
