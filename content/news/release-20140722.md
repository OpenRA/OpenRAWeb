We are pleased to announce the availability of our July release, which includes 619 commits by 27 contributors.

The feature list remains the same as for our [July playtests](/news/playtest-20140709/), but this release benefits from additional testing and bugfixes.  The main new features are:

- The RA and TD game music can now be downloaded and installed from the in-game music player.
- Capturing enemy structures in RA and TD will now let you build units from their faction.
- The maximum tech level can be configured in the lobby options.

Other notable improvements include:

- Fixed a number of crashes that were introduced in the last release.
- Fixed issues that occurred when installing from CD.
- Improved performance and memory usage.
- Improved scroll-panel behaviour.
- Added an option to lock the mouse cursor inside the game window.
- Multiple players can now repair a building at an accelerated rate.
- Added engine support for diamond-shaped ("isometric") terrain (an important milestone for our TS mod).

As usual, the full list of changes compared with the [June release](/news/release-20140608/) is available [on our wiki](http://wiki.openra.net/Changelog).
