We have just released a new playtest with experimental features which includes the changes from previous unstable releases. It is available from the **[download](/download/)** page. After a testing period it will get promoted to a stable release so please [report bugs](http://bugs.open-ra.org) or just [chat with us](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=openra).

#### Changes:

   - An [SDL](http://libsdl.org/) 2.0 renderer has been added (enabled by default on Mac OS X)
   - Resolved problems with Mac OS X Mavericks and backported the packaging fixes to the stable release.
   - User interface polishing: new settings menu, overhauled chat (defaults to team-chat now), improved hotkeys (now supporting modifiers and highlight/disabled effects for all UI elements (thanks to xanax).
   - The Soviet M.A.D. tank which creates an artificial earthquake to damage buildings and tanks has been added to the Red Alert mod by Scott.
   - Haos Ridges, the overpopular map, has been ported to the Tiberian Dawn as well (thanks to sunny).
   - Effect polishing for Tiberian Dawn including more impressive A 10 and MLRS strikes, cash ticks and grenade throwing sounds
