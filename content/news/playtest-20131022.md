The new release of OSX Mavericks has caused some problems for OpenRA (see [#3992](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3992), [#3993](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/3993)).
We are investigating these issues and hope to upload fixed packages before the [2v2 C&C tournament](http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&t=16340) this weekend.

We have also released a new playtest that fixes the targeting bug present
in [playtest-20131019](/news/playtest-20131019/).  If you have been enjoying the
global chat lobby and new RA balance, then you should head over to the
[downloads page](/downloads/) to grab it!
