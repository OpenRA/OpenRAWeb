We are releasing a new playtest today that refines and fixes several issues in the current release.

[The full Changelog](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/c552313bead52fbe4eb2d268e67609ad365205c6) includes:

* Fixed significant performance and behaviour regressions with aircraft
* Fixed rare crashes during gameplay and when loading saved games
* Fixed several behaviour issues with unit and bot AI
* Fixed missing team chat in game replays
* Fixed build failures caused by an [upstream API change](https://blog.maxmind.com/2019/12/18/significant-changes-to-accessing-and-using-geolite2-databases/)
* Improved build icon layout in RA and D2k sidebars
* Improved in-game menu option layout

A new [Mod SDK](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModSDK/releases/tag/20200118) release is also available with a number of additional fixes for modders.

Since we expect this to be the only playtest before a final hotfix release around the start of February, we encourage everybody (especially those who like to play in multiplayer team games) to try a game or two, and to let us know if we have missed any other issues or accidentally introduced new ones.

As always, we welcome feedback in the comments below, on [our forum](https://forum.openra.net), [Discord](https://discord.openra.net), or [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/) pages.

<hr />

Just in time for the holiday season, OpenRA release-20191117 is now available with all of the features and fixes that have been tested and refined in the playtest builds over the past few months.

Big new features like save-game support, new UI for Tiberian Dawn and spectators, and completely overhauled unit behaviours make this one of our most exciting releases to date!

For more details, we hand over to FiveAces who has put together a comprehensive video introduction:
