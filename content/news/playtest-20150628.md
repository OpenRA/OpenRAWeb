Work has been progressing well on our next development cycle, and we are today making a snapshot of this work available in the form of a new playtest release.  [playtest-20150628](/download/) focuses on behind-the-scenes improvements, but also includes a collection of new features and bug fixes.

The most visible changes in this playtest include:

* Removed the "Enemy unit detected" notification, by popular demand.
* A collection of TD balance changes based on player feedback. [[#8303](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8303)]
* Use the repair cursor or order a unit to a repair depot.  In D2K a carryall will pick up the actor. [[#8056](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8056)]
* Units built from the starport in D2K now work with the "select units by type" hotkey. [[#8212](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8212)]
* Improvements to the player name and color validation. [[#8137](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8137), [#8380](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8380)]
* New missions: Nod06b, Nod06c (TD), Soviet02a, Soviet05 (RA), Atreides01a, Atreides01b (D2K).
* A collection of polish fixes for maps, tooltips, and unit artwork.

On the technical front, improvements include:

* A collection of fixes for issues found using [Coverity Scan](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/3650).
* Several new lint tests to detect common YAML errors in maps and mods.
* Changes towards a more consistent set of rendering traits. [[#8171](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8171/)]
* A Significant rework of the shroud code to prepare for TS shroud and scripted map area changes.
* Improved support for compiling and running OpenRA on BSD operating systems.
* Improvements to our [Lua API](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Lua-API-(playtest)) for map authors.

For the full changelog, please refer to [the changelog page on our wiki](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog).

Our new in-game map editor has also received a collection of bug fixes, and the ability to view and edit the area outside the playable map area.  The old map editor (which we inadvertently broke in the last release - sorry!) has been removed.

If you encounter any problems or bugs  (especially anything related to the shroud or any new crashes), then please let us know [on our bug tracker](http://bugs.openra.net) or the comments below.

Use the repair cursor in D2K to signal a Carryall to transport an actor for repair!

The new map editor is more stable, and updated maps now show correctly in the map selection screen.

A preview of things to come: work is nearly complete on rewriting the shroud logic to support terrain height.
