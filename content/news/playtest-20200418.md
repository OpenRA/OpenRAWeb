Just in time for the [upcoming RAGL Season 9](https://forum.openra.net/viewtopic.php?f=85&t=21137), we are today releasing [playtest-20200418](/download/) with several [important fixes and polish changes](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/6ed1ddcaf8ef2f9fbe47ae500f7effa9f8c3efda):

* Fixed a desync crash caused by Minelayers
* Fixed several issues related to Service Depots
* Fixed issues with lobby player colour and faction validation
* Restored country display for anonymous players in server lobbies
* Fixed several issues in the singleplayer campaign

With the recent surge in online player numbers, we want to make sure that the upcoming release is as stable as it can possibly be, so we encourage everybody to play some games on this new playtest and let us know if you find any serious bugs or notice anything else amiss!

In other community news, the Fractured Realms team have [released a trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNoPFWkrvng) for their OpenRA-based game. A preview release should soon be available to download from their [ModDB page](https://www.moddb.com/mods/fractured-realms) if you like the look of it.

<hr />

With the recent [hotfix release](/news/release-20200202/) addressing the worst bugs on the stable branch, we have been able to focus on completing work for the next big release.
We have taken a step back from gameplay this time around, focusing instead on core engine logic and improved UI features.

[Playtest 20200303](/download) is now available, with a overhauled renderer that adds several long-awaited features:

* <span class="about-highlight">Smooth Zooming:</span> The previous "pixel doubling" feature has been updated with the ability to smoothly zoom the battlefield using the mouse wheel or new hotkeys (<span class="about-highlight">[</span> and <span class="about-highlight">]</span>). The default zoom level can be changed using the new Battlefield Camera option in the settings menu.
* <span class="about-highlight">UI size options:</span> Players with larger screen resolutions can increase the size of the menus, sidebar, and other UI elements using the new UI Scale option in the settings menu.
* <span class="about-highlight">Improved HiDPI support:</span> OpenRA can now detect HiDPI rendering modes on Windows and Linux, fixing the blurry rendering for players on Windows with higher resolution screens. Many UI elements now include high resolution artwork, staying crisp when drawn at larger sizes.
* <span class="about-highlight">New introduction screen:</span> A new screen is displayed when launching the game for the first time to introduce the most important display and control options.
* <span class="about-highlight">Overhauled settings menu:</span> The Display and Input settings panels have been refreshed with new options and a new layout.

We note that <span class="about-highlight">OpenGL 3.2 or OpenGL ES 3 are now required</span>. Moving away from OpenGL 2 is important for future compatibility with modern rendering APIs (Vulkan/Metal). This does unfortunately mean dropping support for some older systems (typically 10+ years old) that currently can run OpenRA, but we believe that this is a necessary tradeoff for the future.

Other notable changes in playtest-20200303 include:

* <span class="about-highlight">Updated production rallypoints:</span> Rally points can now be queued (<span class="about-highlight">Shift + Click</span>) to define more complicated paths, and are now hidden until explicitly set.
* <span class="about-highlight">New hotkeys:</span> Shortcuts have been added to select and cycle harvesters (<span class="about-highlight">N</span>) and the production structure associated with the sidebar (<span class="about-highlight">Tab</span>).
* <span class="about-highlight">New spectator Army tab:</span> A new spectator view provides another way to compare player strength.
* <span class="about-highlight">Notarized macOS releases:</span> OpenRA is no longer blocked by the Gatekeeper on recent macOS versions.
* <span class="about-highlight">Improved pathfinding logic:</span> Units are now smarter about moving when their original path is blocked.
* <span class="about-highlight">Map editor improvements:</span> Undo/Redo is now supported, and improvements have been made to Copy/Paste and the actor property editor.

The playtest also includes a collection of modder-focused changes, and marks further progress towards the work-in-progress Tiberian Sun mod with fixes for low-level rendering bugs and new logic for production exits, EMP vs Aircraft, and the Firestorm Generator.
