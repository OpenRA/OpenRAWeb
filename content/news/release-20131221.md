We are proud to present the great 2013 christmas release to you. Over the last 4 months the main focus has been stability and polishing. The additional quality assurance delayed the release a lot, but will hopefully present you with a hazzle-free game experience during the winter holidays.

The main improvements over our last stable [september release](/news/release-20130915/) are:

   - Mission objectives can now be defined via [Lua scripts](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Map-scripting) and shipped inside `.oramap` packages.
   - The main Red Alert has been rebalanced in regards of limiting base-walk and granting a slight production speedup for multiple factories. A new unit (the M.A.D tank) has been added.
   - We renovated the settings menu, added password protected servers as well as new hotkeys and overhauled the in-game chat.
   - Minor improvements include refined pixel doubling, additional infantry idle animations and move-flashes on mouse-clicks.
   - The Dune 2000 and Tiberian Dawn have reached a final stage of graphical overhauls and polishing in regards of spice/shroud rendering and visual effects.
   - A lot more bugfixes and performance improvements. Thanks to everyone who [reported problems](http://bugs.open-ra.org)!

The full list of changes is far too large to include here, so we recommend clicking through to the [human-optimized changelog](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/release-20131221/CHANGELOG) or [full list of commits](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/compare/release-20130915...release-20131221).
