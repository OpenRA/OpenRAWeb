**Update: We have now released a third playtest (20131215) which fixes a few additional issues.**

This is the second release candidate playtest after several days of intensive testing and fixing regressions. Our [stable release milestone](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues?labels=&milestone=4&page=1&state=open) indicates the remaining blockers which is a countdown to zero based on community input. Thanks to everyone who helped testing and reported bugs!

The new features in this build which require special attention to the testing volunteers:

   - Added support for Command & Conquer: Tiberian Dawn and Dune 2000 shroud rendering.
   - Improved the way cliffs, smudges and player color remaps in the d2k mod are rendered.

Checkout the [news section](http://open-ra.org/news/) on our website to get an idea what the previous playtests introduced. As usual, the [changelog](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/playtest-20131211/CHANGELOG) contains all the details, including a list of changes that affect maps and mods.

The Tiberian Dawn mod now uses the original shroud artwork and has smoother transitions between shroud to fog and visible terrain.

The Dune 2000 mod now uses the original shroud and crater artwork. This also showcases the [recently improved spice rendering](http://open-ra.org/news/playtest-20131209/).
